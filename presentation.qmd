## Puzzle, Question, and Argument 

:::{style="font-size: 95%"}

- Puzzle: 
  - Comparated to democracy, we know less about the 
  support for the ideals, norms, and principles of non-
  democratic regimes (p.1855)

- Question:
  - Are voters who share the ideals of non-democratic regimes
  less likely to abandon the incumbent during economic downturns?
  (p.1855)

- Argument:
  - In times of economic crises, *instrumental support* is mostly 
  affected and will result in a decrease in electoral support. Poor 
  performance will reduce electoral support; but this effect is 
  *conditional on the initial level of support* for the dominant party; 
  and voters with higher level of instrumental and normative support 
  are less likely to defect (Hypotheses 1, 2, 3a, and 3b)

## Data 

- Two surveys fielded in Turkey between May 9 and 24 2021 (n = 6111)

- Respondents were recruited via Facebook advertisements (opt-in survey)
  - Slightly imbalanced samples (female and non-high school respondents),
  so they use post-stratification weights to correct for this

- Use CSES 2018 data collection in Turkey to cross-validate their findings

## Research Design

- DV: They develop context-specific items
  - 10 items to measure general normative support
  - 4 items to measure normative support for the AKP
  - 6 items to measure instrumental support for the regime

- Create three indices (scales) with these items
  - One with all of them 
  - One only with normative items
  - One only with instrumental items

- The dimensionality was tested using EFA

- Estimate treatment effect using OLS without controls

::: {.notes}
- All survey items were on a 0-4 scale, they 
calculate the avg on each scale and multiply it 
by 25 to interpret the results as percentage 
points
:::

## Research Design

- Two surveys:
  1. Priming was administered *before* asking the support questions
    - Hypothesis 1
  2. Priming was administered *after* asking the support questions
    - Hypotheses 2 and 3

## Empirical Results

1. Descriptive Analysis
  - The unidimensional understanding of normative and instrumental 
  support in Turkey
  - Average level of normative support greater than instrumental support
    - Important differences in the level of instrumental 
    and normative support conditioned on the government 
    voters

## Empirical Results {style="font-size: 80%"}

2. Experiment
  - Hypothesis 1: 
    - Treated group, and government voters, have lower 
    levels of instrumental support, but similar levels of normative support
    - Treatment "ineffective" for non-government voters (already low level 
    of instrumental and normative support)

  - Hypothesis 2: 
    - Added income as a control given the imbalance in the second survey
    - Stronger effect in government voters, where being prompted about 
    economic crisis reduces the probability to vote and to mobilize for the 
    government *relative to the control group*

  - Hypothesis 3:
    - People with higher support for the government are less likely to defect
    - Replication with CSES still shows that people who strongly like the party 
    are not defecting from it given the poor economic situation

::: {.notes}
- The descriptive part was done using only the group that 
received the DV *before* the treatment (no priming effect)
:::

## Replication

![](images/replication.png)

## Limits

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 80%"}

1. Potential heterogeneity for income levels and occupation given the treatment 
  that is left untested

2. The adaptation of the items in the context of Turkey leads to an increase in 
    internal validity but potentially low external validity. 

3. Exploratory factor analysis (appendix)
    - Used the Kaiser criterion to retain the number of factors, which has been 
    extensively criticized [@timmerman_etal18].
    - No scree plot 

4. Measurement invariance:
    - The unfortunaltely common reality of measurement and scale construction in social 
      sciences

5. Bifactor model:
    - What is this unidimensional structure?
    - Is it composed of both normative and instrumental preferences? 
    - Could they be two distinct components of a larger meaningful factor?

## The Vignette

"Turkey is dealing with an economic crisis for several years now.
Since the beginning of 2020, the value of the dollar has increased
from 6 TL (Turkish Liras) to 8.3 TL as the Turkish lira’s value
decreased by around 25%. As a result of these economic problems,
the Turkish economy has dropped three places in the ranking of the
world’s biggest economies. Turkey’s economic problems reveal
themselves in daily life too. Many citizens complain about the
continuous increase in prices. Another issue is unemployment, which
is especially common among the youth."

## Future Research

::: {.incremental}

- The difficult task to recover "true" public preferences
  in authoritarian regimes
  - Bayesian IRT

- Predicting defection more accurately: 
  - Machine learning approach to estimate the conditions where we 
  can expect people to defect in elections using ridge regression 
  and K--fold cross--validation on larger samples
  - A descriptive approach might yield greater information about 
  the "real-world situation" where we can expect citizens to 
  defect [@gerring12]
