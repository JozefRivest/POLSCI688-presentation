  abstract = {This chapter focuses on formal criteria to assess the dimensionality for exploratory factor modelling with the aim to facilitate the selection of a proper criterion in empirical practice. It introduces the different foundations that underlie the various criteria and provides an overview of currently available formal criteria, which we selected on the basis of their popularity in empirical practice and/or proven effectiveness. The chapter successively reviews principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods and common factor analysis (CFA)-based methods to assess the number of common factors. To assess the number of factors underlying an empirical data set, the chapter suggests some strategies. It explains the finding in many studies that the Kaiser criterion clearly yields inaccurate indications of the number of PCs and common factors, mostly indicating too many factors. Minimum average partial (MAP) performances in indicating the number of major factors deteriorated when the unique variances increased, with no clear tendency to over- or underindicate the number of factors.},

  abstract = {This article attempts to reformulate and resuscitate the seemingly prosaic methodological task of description, which is often derided in favour of causal analysis. First, the problem of definition is addressed: what does this category of analysis (‘description’) refer to? Secondly, a taxonomy of descriptive arguments is offered, emphasizing the diversity contained within this genre of empirical analysis. Thirdly, the demise of description within political science is charted over the past century, with comparisons to other disciplines. Fourthly, it is argued that the task of description ought to be approached independently, not merely as a handmaiden of causal theories. Fifthly, the methodological difficulties of descriptive inference are addressed. Finally, fruitful research areas within the rubric of description are reviewed.},
